# Learning to use Git and Github with Front End Web Development

This text file includes some of the commonly used git commands used to version control projects.
I will be adding the commands I used to add, commit, and update my code on this repository.

Learning from Shay Hawe's [Learn To Code](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

**Commonly used commands:**
```
git config --global user.name "USERNAME"
git config --global user.email "useremail"
terminal - go to the location of the folder/project
git init
git status
git add
git commit -m "..."
git remote add origin "location of remote repo"
git push -u origin master
git log
git --help
```
